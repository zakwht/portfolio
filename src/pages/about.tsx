      <p>
        Hi <span style={{color: "transparent", textShadow: "0 0 0 mediumseagreen"}}>ðŸ‘‹</span> I'm Zak, a software developer based in Victoria, BC.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a 2022 University of Victoria grad, having earned an honours bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in statistics.
        Of big interest to me are the fields at the intersection of these two disciplines: data science, machine learning, analysis of algorithms.
        My other academic interests include machine ethics, graph theory, and optimization algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my development experience involves building web applications with React &amp; TypeScript, with a focus on encompassing the Semantic Web.
        I've worked within the scope of many programming paradigms, using languages including Java, Python, Racket, and R.
